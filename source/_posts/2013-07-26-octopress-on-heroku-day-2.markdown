### Tasks
1. Added several plugins, including comments from disqus, my reading from douban, QR code and readability
    * All these plugins and _even more_ can be found [here](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins)

### Problems
1. The explanation for Douban plugin is misleading, fixed and sent a pull request

### Next
1. Use sub modules to manage third party plugins?
2. A better place for facebook like and twitter buttons?
3. Themes update
4. Blogs!
